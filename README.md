# 🐍 Python OOP: Abstract Class & Method Example

## 🎯 AIM

To create an **abstract class** named `Shape` with an **abstract method** `calculate_area`, and implement this method in two subclasses: `Rectangle` and `Circle`.

---

## 🧠 ALGORITHM

1. **Import ABC module**:
   - Use `from abc import ABC, abstractmethod` to define abstract classes and methods.

2. **Create Abstract Class `Shape`**:
   - Define an abstract method `calculate_area()` with `@abstractmethod`.

3. **Create Subclass `Rectangle`**:
   - Set default values for `length` and `breadth`.
   - Override `calculate_area()` to compute the rectangle area.

4. **Create Subclass `Circle`**:
   - Set default value for `radius`.
   - Override `calculate_area()` to compute the circle area.

5. **Create Objects & Call Methods**:
   - Instantiate `Rectangle` and `Circle`.
   - Call their `calculate_area()` methods.

---

## 💻 Program
```

from abc import ABC
class type_shape(ABC): 
    def area(self):
        pass

class Rectangle(type_shape):
    length = 6
    breadth = 4
    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.breadth

class Circle(type_shape):
    radius = 7
    def area(self):
        return 3.14*self.radius**2
class Square(type_shape):
    length = 4
    def area(self):
        return self.length**2

class triangle(type_shape):
    length = 5
    width = 4
    def area(self):
        return 0.5*self.length*self.width
  
r = Rectangle()
c = Circle() 
s = Square() 
t = triangle() 
print("Area of a rectangle:", r.area())
print("Area of a circle:", c.area()) 
print("Area of a square:", s.area()) 
print("Area of a triangle:", t.area())
```

## Result
The program successfully demonstrates the concept of abstract classes and method overriding in Python.
The abstract class Shape defines the structure, and the subclasses Rectangle and Circle implement their own versions of the calculate_area() method.

# 🐍 Python OOP: Encapsulation with Private Members

## 🎯 AIM

To implement **Encapsulation** in Python by defining a class `Rectangle` with **private member variables** `__length` and `__breadth`.

---

## 🧠 ALGORITHM

1. **Define the Class**:
   - Create a class `Rectangle` with two private attributes: `__length` and `__breadth`.

2. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Use the `__init__()` constructor to set initial values for `__length` and `__breadth`.

3. **Print Values**:
   - Display the private variables from within the class to demonstrate access.

4. **Instantiate the Object**:
   - Create an object of the `Rectangle` class to trigger the constructor.

---

## 💻 Program
```
class Rectangle:
    __length = 0 
    __breadth = 0
    def __init__(self):
      self.__length = 5
      self.__breadth = 3
      print(self.__length)
      print(self.__breadth)
   
  obj = Rectangle()
```

## Output
<img width="290" height="132" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3df50c49-54d3-4b3e-be8f-056ea7e6cc3b" />

## Result
Thus, the program to implement Encapsulation with Private Members in Python was executed successfully and produced the expected result.

# 🐟 Method Overriding-Fish and Shark Class Inheritance in Python

## 🧠 AIM:
To write a Python program that demonstrates class inheritance by creating a parent class `Fish` with a method `type`, and a child class `Shark` that overrides the `type` method.

## 📋 ALGORITHM:

1. Define the `Fish` class with a method named `type()` that prints `"fish"`.
2. Define the `Shark` class as a subclass of `Fish`, and override the `type()` method to print `"shark"`.
3. Create an instance of the `Fish` class named `obj_goldfish`.
4. Create an instance of the `Shark` class named `obj_hammerhead`.
5. Use a `for` loop to iterate over both objects.
6. Within the loop, call the `type()` method using the loop variable.
7. Output will demonstrate method overriding: printing `"fish"` and `"shark"` accordingly.

## 💻 PROGRAM:
```
class Fish:
    def type(self):
        print("fish")

class Shark(Fish):
	def type(self):
	    print("shark")

obj_goldfish=Fish()
obj_hammerhead=Shark()

obj_goldfish.type()
obj_hammerhead.type()
```
## OUTPUT
<img width="631" height="391" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9a37dcd-4ef3-47b1-8ad2-ecc3a4b2a39a" />

## RESULT
Thus, the program to implement Method Overriding using Fish and Shark Class Inheritance in Python was executed successfully and produced the expected result.
